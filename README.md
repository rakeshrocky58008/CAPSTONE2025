# Capstone 2025 â€“ Smart Emergency Response System

This project implements a GPT-powered multi-agent emergency response system using anomaly detection and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It features agents specialized in fire, medical, and crime domains, integrating threat assessment and resource optimization.

## Features
- Multi-agent GPT-based architecture
- Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
- Semantic search using embeddings + FAISS
- Role-based threat classification
- Visualizations and interactive outputs

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Notebooks
Original development and experiments are in `notebooks/`.
